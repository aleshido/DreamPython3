# DreamPython3

Script that automates the modem configuration and makes the listener compatible with Python 3. Information about the initial version of the script, made by Petri Trebilcock, can be found at http://www.dreamcast-talk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=7598.

## Important Note
This script is designed to run on modern Ubuntu OS systems as an alternative to DreamPi, which currently has compatibility issues with Raspberry Pi 5. This is an experimental solution that has worked in my specific use case. Please use at your own discretion, as consistent support cannot be guaranteed.
